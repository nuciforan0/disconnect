# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YouTube Subscription Manager is a web application that helps users manage their YouTube video consumption by providing a personalized feed of recent videos from subscribed channels. Users can mark videos as watched or skipped to remove them from their feed, with automatic syncing every 3 hours to fetch new content. The application uses Google OAuth for authentication and provides an embedded YouTube player for seamless video viewing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a YouTube user, I want to authenticate with my Google account, so that I can access my YouTube subscriptions and personalize my video feed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login page with Google OAuth option
2. WHEN a user clicks the Google login button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. WHEN a user grants permission THEN the system SHALL store access and refresh tokens securely
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the main video feed
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to see a feed of recent videos from my subscribed channels, so that I can easily discover new content without visiting YouTube directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first logs in THEN the system SHALL fetch their YouTube subscriptions and store them in the database
2. WHEN the system fetches subscriptions THEN it SHALL retrieve recent videos from each subscribed channel
3. WHEN displaying the video feed THEN the system SHALL show video thumbnail, title, channel name, and upload date
4. WHEN the video feed loads THEN the system SHALL display videos sorted by upload date (newest first)
5. IF no videos are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing my video feed, I want to mark videos as watched or skipped, so that I can remove content I'm not interested in and keep my feed clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a video card THEN the system SHALL display "Watch" and "Skip" action buttons
2. WHEN a user clicks "Watch" or "Skip" THEN the system SHALL immediately remove the video from the UI
3. WHEN a video is marked as watched or skipped THEN the system SHALL delete it from the database
4. WHEN a video is removed THEN it SHALL NOT appear in future feed refreshes
5. IF the removal operation fails THEN the system SHALL restore the video to the UI and show an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to watch videos in an embedded player within the application, so that I can view content without leaving the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a video thumbnail or title THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated video page
2. WHEN the video page loads THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen YouTube embedded player
3. WHEN the embedded player loads THEN it SHALL automatically start playing the selected video
4. WHEN viewing a video THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to the main feed
5. WHEN the player is displayed THEN it SHALL support all standard YouTube controls (play, pause, fullscreen, quality settings)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my video feed to automatically update with new content, so that I don't miss recent uploads from my subscribed channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 3 hours have passed since the last sync THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch new videos from subscribed channels
2. WHEN fetching new videos THEN the system SHALL only retrieve content published after the last sync timestamp
3. WHEN new videos are found THEN the system SHALL store them in the database
4. WHEN the user refreshes or revisits the application THEN new videos SHALL appear in their feed
5. IF the sync process fails THEN the system SHALL retry and log the error for monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to persist and refresh automatically, so that I don't have to re-login frequently while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it using the stored refresh token
2. WHEN token refresh is successful THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without user intervention
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page
4. WHEN a user closes and reopens the application THEN their session SHALL persist if tokens are still valid
5. IF tokens are compromised or invalid THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide feedback, so that I understand what's happening when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YouTube API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL show loading states and retry options
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback
4. WHEN quota limits are reached THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest retry timing
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging while showing generic user messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work well on both desktop and mobile devices, so that I can manage my video feed from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on mobile THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN viewing the video feed THEN it SHALL adapt to different screen sizes appropriately
3. WHEN watching videos on mobile THEN the embedded player SHALL support mobile gestures and fullscreen
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN all interactive elements SHALL be appropriately sized for touch input
5. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt accordingly
